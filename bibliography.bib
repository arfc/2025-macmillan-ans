	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {This work assesses system parameters that influence separation efficiency and throughput of pyroprocessing facilities. We leverage these parameters to implement a customizable pyroprocessing facility archetype, PyRe, for use with the Cyclus framework. This generic facility model will allow simulations to quantify signatures and observables associated with various operational modes and material throughputs for a variety of facility designs. Such quantification can aid timely detection of material diversion. This paper describes the facility archetype design, pyroprocessing flowsheets captured by the model, and simulation capabilities it enables. To analyze data retrieved from the model, we additionally propose a class for tracking and observing signatures and observables which will be extensible for other facility archetypes in the future.},

	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF)
steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in
which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this
transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels,
and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation
reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguardsby-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived
through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety
of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class
capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material
production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and
current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections
and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a
sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined
through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between
the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also
expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel
cycle fidelity.},
